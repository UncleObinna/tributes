      <li>
        <strong>1937</strong> - Finishes university and takes a job in the US

        laid off due to budget cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, he
        returns to school study under Stakman, who teaches him about breeding
        pest-resistent plants.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1941</strong> - Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl
        Harbor attack, but is rejected. Instead, the military asked his lab to

      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1942</strong> - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1944</strong> - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont,
        leaves behind his pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new plant
        pathology program. Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000
        different strains of disease resistent wheat - including different
        varieties for each major climate on Earth.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1945</strong> - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each
        season, doubling wheat yields
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1953</strong> - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat
        with a high-yeidling American breed, creating a strain that responds
        well to fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1962</strong> - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding
        strains of wheat to the Indian subcontinent in time to help mitigate

        supply by 2050." Argues that genetically modified crops are the only way
        we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops
        are not inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying
        plants and animals for a long time. Long before we called it science,
        people were selecting the best breeds."
      </li>
      <li><strong>2009</strong> - dies at the age of 95.</li>
